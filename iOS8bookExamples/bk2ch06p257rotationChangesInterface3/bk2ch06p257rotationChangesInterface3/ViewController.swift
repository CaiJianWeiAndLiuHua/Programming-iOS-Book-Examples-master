    // Surprise, iOS 8 has conditional constraints in the nib!
    // solves the whole problem, badda bing badda boom
    
    // made slightly more complicated by:
    // (1) inability to express certain relationships in IB
    // (2) fact that status bar will be hidden in landscape only by default...
    // ...thus shifting the top guide which is the only thing we can pin to in IB
